    Hide Gradle from IntelliJ (#109)
    
    Since our project is meant to be built with IntelliJ, and without
    Gradle, remove the Gradle wrapper and rename the `build.gradle` file to
    `build.gradle.txt` so that IntelliJ won't think that we have a Gradle
    build file in the repo.

      [2/3] Remove Gradle wrapper
      [3/3] Rename `build.gradle` to `build.gradle.txt`

    Rename `build.gradle` to `build.gradle.txt`
    
    We have a `build.gradle` file in the repo which tells Travis/Netlify how
    to build our documentation with asciidoctor.
    
    However, when importing this repo as a project, IntelliJ will detect the
    `build.gradle` file and prompt the user with the following:
    
        Unlinked Gradle project?
    
        Import Gradle project, this will also enable Gradle Tool Window...
    
    The correct action that should be taken by the user in this case is
    _not_ to "Import Gradle project", as this project is meant to be built
    without Gradle. However, this prompt may mislead the user into choosing
    the wrong thing.
    
    Fix this by renaming `build.gradle` into `build.gradle.txt`. Keeping the
    term `build.gradle` in the filename will allow readers to easily
    identify the file as a `build.gradle` file, while the `.txt` extension
    will make IntelliJ, and likely all other IDEs, stop identifying it as a
    Gradle file (since text files, by definition, can contain anything).

    Remove Gradle wrapper
    
    Our repo contains the Gradle wrapper to ensure that the correct Gradle
    version is used when we are building our documentation with asciidoctor.
    
    However, IntelliJ has a strange quirk where if:
    
      * The project is imported by "Create Project from existing Sources",
        and,
    
      * The `gradle-wrapper.jar` in the repo is selected as a library
        (which is done by default)
    
    then IntelliJ might end up marking the `src` directory as "not a sources
    root directory", resulting in IntelliJ not being able to compile and run
    the project[1].
    
    While workarounds exists (such as telling users not to select
    `gradle-wrapper.jar` in the library selection stage), ultimately this
    boils down to the fact that we include the gradle wrapper in the repo
    even though ordinary users won't be using it.
    
    So, let's remove the Gradle wrapper in the repo.
    
    To ensure that Travis/Netlify install and use the correct Gradle
    version, let's set up a system where Travis/Netlify will download the
    Gradle wrapper at build time. We are already hosting the Gradle wrapper
    of the version we want at https://se-edu.github.io/gradle-wrapper
    
    Once the Gradle wrapper is gone, we also don't need the troubleshooting
    step added by [1] anymore, so let's remove it.

    Add netlify.toml
    
    We use Netlify to build and host deploy previews of our documentation
    for our PRs. Currently, Netlify is configured to build our documentation
    using the command "./gradlew asciidoctor".
    
    Without a netlify.toml file in our repo, only the Nelify account owner
    can change that command, which is inconvenient.
    
    Let's add a netlify.toml file to the repo, so that any committer to the
    repo can change the Netlify configuration.

    DeveloperGuide: add solution to src being treated as normal folder (#105)
    
    Occasionally, new developers may accidentally import the project as
    a Gradle project.
    
    This cause IntelliJ to often triggers Gradle synchronization which
    allows Gradle to impose the project to use its configuration. Due
    to this issue, developers will encounter the problem of marked
    directory keep getting reset upon restarting IntelliJ.
    
    Let's add the solution to this problem in the troubleshooting
    section to help the developers who have accidentally misconfigured
    the importation.

    runtests.bat script does not work outside the test folder.
    
    Developers working on the project often have their working directory
    set to the root of the project. It is inconvenient to switch in and out
    of the test folder repeatedly in an edit-debug cycle.
    
    To reduce the hassle, let's add the commands in bat script to perform
    the switching of directory automatically and hence increase our

    [#103] LearningOutcomes.adoc: fix link to download code (#104)
    
    Before fb74fba, learning outcomes were written in README.adoc.
    Developers were instructed to use the 'Clone or download' button
    **above** the page, when viewing README.adoc on GitHub.
    
    This instruction no longer make sense after learning outcomes have a
    .adoc page on its own. Furthermore, the 'Clone or download' button will
    not be available on the rendered static website version anyway, even if
    it stayed in README.adoc.
    
    Let's fix the instruction's link to download code, by using the
    `site-githuburl` attribute declared in `build.gradle`. That attribute
    will not be declared when viewing the .adoc page on GitHub, so declare a
    separate attribute for `env-github` environment.

    Runtests scripts compile the program under test, before executing the

    Translate markdown files into asciidoc files
    
    We are going to convert all of our documentation from markdown to
    asciidoc format, in order to take advantage of the additional features
    and semantic elements that asciidoc offers such as automatic section
    numbering, admonitions and automatic table of contents (TOC) generation.
    
    Converting README.md by hand is going to be extremely tedious.
    
    As such, as a step towards the full conversion of our documentation to
    asciidoc, let's enlist the help of pandoc[1] to translate our
    documentation.
    
    The translation is done with pandoc 2.2.1 via this shell script:
    
        for x in $(find -name '*.md'); do
            pandoc -f markdown_github-hard_line_breaks --wrap=preserve --atx-headers -o "${x%*.md}.adoc" "$x"
        done
    
    While the majority of the translation is done faithfully, there are
    still some errors here and there in the translated files. We will be
    fixing them in subsequent commits.

    The default storage file 'addressbook.txt' is not provided by default.

    Due to the additional information in the log, the first test run after
    cloning the master always result in failure, as the additional
    information creates a difference between actual.txt and expected.txt,
